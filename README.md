## Introduction

The `useState` hook is a built-in hook in React that allows you to manage state in functional components. This project includes a simple counter application to demonstrate how to use the `useState` hook effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-usestate-example.git
    cd react-usestate-example
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the App

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action.

## Code Explanation

### Counter Component

This example includes a simple counter component that demonstrates the usage of the `useState` hook.

**`src/App.jsx`**:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  // Declare a state variable named "count" with initial value 0
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Function to handle incrementing the count
  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  // Function to handle decrementing the count
  const decrement = () => {
    setCount(count - 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

### How It Works

1. **Import `useState`:**

    ```javascript
    import React, { useState } from 'react';
    ```

2. **Declare State Variable:**

    ```javascript
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    ```

    - `count` is the state variable.
    - `setCount` is the function to update the state.
    - `0` is the initial value of `count`.

3. **Update State:**

    - The `increment` function increases the `count` by 1.
    - The `decrement` function decreases the `count` by 1.

4. **Render the Component:**

    ```javascript
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
        <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
        <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
      </div>
    );
    ```

## Conclusion

This project provides a basic example of how to use the `useState` hook in React. The `useState` hook is essential for managing state in functional components, making it a crucial tool for React developers.
